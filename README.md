# Road Accident Data Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing road accident data to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help improve road safety. The project involves three major tasks:

- Data Cleaning & Validation: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the dataset.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering trends and patterns in the data through analysis.
- Interactive Dashboard Creation: Developing a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Excel for real-time data insights.

The dataset used in this project contains road accident data, and after extensive cleaning and analysis, it was used to build an interactive Excel dashboard for stakeholders to make informed decisions.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following components:

### 1.Data Cleaning and Validation
- Data cleaning included handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and standardizing formats to ensure data integrity.
- Validation steps involved cross-checking data for duplicates, outliers, and any erroneous entries that could skew the results.
- Some of the main columns in the dataset included accident type, location, weather conditions, and time of the incident, among others.

### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase focused on understanding key trends in road accidents, such as the time of day, day of the week, and geographical hotspots.
Various statistical visualizations and insights were generated, including histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots, to identify patterns related to accident frequency, severity, and contributing factors like weather, road conditions, etc.
The analysis helped identify critical areas that need attention for safety improvements, such as high-risk locations or accident-prone times.

### 3.. Interactive Dashboard in Excel
- After completing the data cleaning and analysis, an interactive Excel dashboard was created to visualize key metrics and trends.
- The dashboard includes:
- Charts to represent accident frequency by time, day, and location.
- Filtering options to view accidents by different attributes such as severity, weather, and location.
- Real-time updates based on the most current data, allowing stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

File Limitations
Due to GitHub’s file upload limit of 25MB, I am unable to upload the dataset directly to this repository. The dataset used in this analysis exceeds the 25MB limit. However, you can download the dataset from the following external link (if applicable): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R_uaoZL18nRbqC_MULVne90h3SdRbAyn/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116890999875311477003&rtpof=true&sd=true
